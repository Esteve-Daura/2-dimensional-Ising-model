The Montecarlo_simulation.py file contains the whole simulation for a certain lattice size which can be changed. It provides the plots for energy, magnetization, susceptibility and heat capacity with respect to the temperature, whith their respective numerical errors, and the Onsager solution for the energy and the magnetization. The second file provides the statistical analysis, also for both systems. It gives the thermalization plot as well as the Gelman-Rubin statistic and the autocorrelation time for a set temperature.
